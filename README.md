## 🌟 Project Overview
This is a simplified clone of the popular Airbnb platform, created as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. It replicates core functionalities such as listing properties, searching, and booking using a modular, scalable, and testable codebase.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of back-end web architecture.
- Build a dynamic web application using OOP in Python.
- Practice working with file storage, databases, and web frameworks.
- Learn to collaborate using Git, GitHub, and coding best practices.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
