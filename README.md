# AirBnB Clone Project

## 🌟 Project Overview
This is a simplified clone of the popular Airbnb platform, created as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. It replicates core functionalities such as listing properties, searching, and booking using a modular, scalable, and testable codebase.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of back-end web architecture.
- Build a dynamic web application using OOP in Python.
- Practice working with file storage, databases, and web frameworks.
- Learn to collaborate using Git, GitHub, and coding best practices.

## Technology Stack

The AirBnB Clone project uses the following technologies to build a robust and scalable web platform:

### 🐍 Python
Primary programming language used to develop backend logic and APIs.

### 🌐 Flask
A lightweight web framework for building RESTful APIs. Handles routing, request/response handling, and middleware integration.

### 🐬 MySQL
Relational database system used to store and manage structured data such as user accounts, property listings, bookings, etc.

### 🧪 Unittest
Python’s built-in testing framework used to write unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability and prevent regressions.

### 🔗 RESTful API
Architectural style used to design the backend API, enabling communication between the frontend (if applicable) and backend over HTTP.

### 🛠️ Git & GitHub
Version control system used for tracking changes and collaborating as a team. GitHub hosts the repository and allows for issue tracking and pull requests.

### ☁️ Linux/Ubuntu (CLI)
Used as the development environment, often with Bash commands and scripts to manage server configurations, run programs, and automate tasks.

### 🛡️ API Security
Best practices implemented to secure endpoints, authenticate users, and prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).


## 🔐 API Security
To ensure secure access to the application:
- All API endpoints will implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Sensitive data will be encrypted and protected using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
- Rate-limiting and input validation will be used to prevent abuse and vulnerabilities.
- We will follow OWASP best practices for web API security.
## Team Roles

For the successful delivery of the AirBnB Clone project, the team members are assigned clear and collaborative roles inspired by software engineering best practices:

### 👨‍💻 Backend Developer
Responsible for building the core logic of the application using Python. This includes implementing routes, controllers, and handling requests/responses using the Flask framework.

### 🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Ensures proper design, management, and optimization of the MySQL database. Handles schema creation, relationships, indexing, and ensures data integrity and security.

### 🌐 API Designer
Designs and documents RESTful API endpoints. Defines clear routes, response formats, and ensures the API adheres to standards for maintainability and usability.

### 🔐 DevOps/Security Lead
Implements version control (Git), manages deployment processes, and enforces security best practices like HTTPS, access control, and environment variable management.

### 🧪 QA/Test Engineer
Writes and executes unit and integration tests to ensure functionality, performance, and reliability. Automates testing where possible to ensure continuous quality.

### 📝 Documentation Lead
Maintains project documentation including the README, API documentation, and guides for setup, contribution, and testing.

### 🧭 Project Coordinator
Tracks progress, manages timelines, organizes meetings, and ensures team alignment with ALX project deliverables and deadlines.

## 👨‍💻 Team
Developed by Muwanuguzi Mark Miiro and team as part of the ALX SE Curriculum.
