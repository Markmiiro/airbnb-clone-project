# AirBnB Clone Project

## 🌟 Project Overview
This is a simplified clone of the popular Airbnb platform, created as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. It replicates core functionalities such as listing properties, searching, and booking using a modular, scalable, and testable codebase.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of back-end web architecture.
- Build a dynamic web application using OOP in Python.
- Practice working with file storage, databases, and web frameworks.
- Learn to collaborate using Git, GitHub, and coding best practices.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Testing**: Unittest

## 🔐 API Security
To ensure secure access to the application:
- All API endpoints will implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Sensitive data will be encrypted and protected using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
- Rate-limiting and input validation will be used to prevent abuse and vulnerabilities.
- We will follow OWASP best practices for web API security.
## Team Roles

For the successful delivery of the AirBnB Clone project, the team members are assigned clear and collaborative roles inspired by software engineering best practices:

### 👨‍💻 Backend Developer
Responsible for building the core logic of the application using Python. This includes implementing routes, controllers, and handling requests/responses using the Flask framework.

### 🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Ensures proper design, management, and optimization of the MySQL database. Handles schema creation, relationships, indexing, and ensures data integrity and security.

### 🌐 API Designer
Designs and documents RESTful API endpoints. Defines clear routes, response formats, and ensures the API adheres to standards for maintainability and usability.

### 🔐 DevOps/Security Lead
Implements version control (Git), manages deployment processes, and enforces security best practices like HTTPS, access control, and environment variable management.

### 🧪 QA/Test Engineer
Writes and executes unit and integration tests to ensure functionality, performance, and reliability. Automates testing where possible to ensure continuous quality.

### 📝 Documentation Lead
Maintains project documentation including the README, API documentation, and guides for setup, contribution, and testing.

### 🧭 Project Coordinator
Tracks progress, manages timelines, organizes meetings, and ensures team alignment with ALX project deliverables and deadlines.
